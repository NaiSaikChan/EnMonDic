## 💡 Search Logic

* If search text starts with a-z or A-Z:

  * First query: `english BEGINSWITH[cd] %@`
  * Fallback query: `mon CONTAINS[cd] %@`

* Else:

  * Query: `english ==[cd] %@ OR mon CONTAINS[cd] %@`

* **Results are ordered** with exact matches shown first, followed by partial matches.

---

## 🗃️ First Launch Setup

* On first app launch, a built-in JSON file (`dictionary_a.json`) is parsed and imported into CoreData.
* Future launches skip the import using a `UserDefaults` flag: `isDataImported`.
